# CODE QUALITY
## Series introduction
### What is code quality?
> Code quality is a loose approximation of how long-term useful and long-term maintainable the code is.

In practice, each company, each team has its own set of attributes and requirements determining code quality based on specific business's needs. Some common criteria are:
* Understandable (or clarity)
* Maintainable
* Documented
* Well-tested
* Performance
* And many more

### Why do we need to keep the bar of code quality really high?

Remember the last time you're on a large project, or maybe on a codebase that people worked for several months or even years? Everything was implemented messily, and then you changed something, you broke something else accidentally. Even worse, I guess many of you have experienced technical debt and still remember how painful it was?  What did you do in that situation? Did you go crazy? Did you spend a lot of time testing, verifying, or asking your colleagues to be confident that you're not breaking something? Well, it's reasonable to blame on former developers for not keeping code quality high enough. So, the bottom line: write great code, and then it will make your life easier, make the life of future colleagues much more manageable.

> Technical debt (also known as design debt or code debt) is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost fo additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

### How to increase your code quality?
If you've reflected on your code and wondered if you could have made it better, then this series is just for you. Sometimes you might need to have a strong motivation on the go. I suggest to chose wisely something that matters you the most. Below is a quote from Mr. ChienTX that you can keep in mind as your guide.

> You're not writing code, you're writing your profile.

This series will go through several topics aiming to show you how / help you to write high-quality code which is easier to understand, has minimal bugs and of course, does what the business expects it to do. Stay tuned.
